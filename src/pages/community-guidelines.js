					Kohort community guidelines
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontFamily='Silka Regular' fontSize='16px' gutterBottom>
					We welcome contributions from everyone who shares our goals and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community. As such, we have adopted this code of
					conduct and require all those who participate to agree and adhere to these Community Participation Guidelines to help us create a safe and positive community experience for all.
					These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas, and inspire others regardless of background, family status,
					gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, race and/or ethnicity, caste, national origin, socioeconomic status,
					religion, geographic location, or other aspects of diversity.
					<br />
					<br />
					We are stronger together as a community than alone so we focus on creating a safe space for diversity, collaboration, and inclusivity. These guidelines exist to enable diverse
					individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.
					<br />
					<br />

					Expected Behavior
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='24px' component='div' fontFamily='Gosha Sans' fontWeight='bold' color='#333333' sx={{ marginBottom: '28px', marginTop: '22px' }}>
					Value and Respect One Another
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					Value each other’s ideas, styles, and perspectives. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be respectful in all interactions and communications,
					especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may affect people. Be direct, constructive, and positive. Take
					responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the
					behavior moving forward.
				</Typography>

				<Typography fontSize='24px' component='div' fontFamily='Gosha Sans' fontWeight='bold' color='#333333' sx={{ marginBottom: '28px', marginTop: '22px' }}>
					Be Inclusive
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard
					and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken
					up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible. Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating
					people’s participation. Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for
					other voices and listen actively.
				</Typography>

				<Typography fontSize='24px' component='div' fontFamily='Gosha Sans' fontWeight='bold' color='#333333' sx={{ marginBottom: '28px', marginTop: '22px' }}>
					Understand Different Perspectives
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					Our goal should not be &apos;to win&apos; every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive
					thinking. &apos;Winning&apos; is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.
				</Typography>

				<Typography fontSize='24px' component='div' fontFamily='Gosha Sans' fontWeight='bold' color='#333333' sx={{ marginBottom: '28px', marginTop: '22px' }}>
					Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					We have a global community with members that come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal
					habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes, and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices, and discriminatory practices.
					Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality.
					Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect others to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group,
					but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.
				</Typography>

				<Typography fontSize='24px' component='div' fontFamily='Gosha Sans' fontWeight='bold' color='#333333' sx={{ marginBottom: '28px', marginTop: '22px' }}>
					Lead by Example
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate
					for our organizational outcomes. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors.
				</Typography>

				<Typography variant='h3' fontSize='36px' component='div' fontWeight='bold' color='#333333' sx={{ marginBottom: '28px', marginTop: '35px' }}>
					Behavior Not Tolerated
				</Typography>

				<Typography fontSize='24px' component='div' fontFamily='Gosha Sans' fontWeight='bold' color='#333333' sx={{ marginBottom: '28px', marginTop: '22px' }}>
					Spam or Phishing
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					You should not schedule review sessions for commercial reasons; abuse the mentor programme; attempt to drive traffic to other sites or market unrelated products; or make false
					claims against other members of the community.
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='24px' component='div' fontFamily='Gosha Sans' fontWeight='bold' color='#333333' sx={{ marginBottom: '28px', marginTop: '22px' }}>
					Violating Others&apos; Privacy or IP Rights
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					You should not ask anything beyond design-related topics unless both parties consent. You should not violate others&apos; privacy, copyrights, or trademarks in their work or speech. You
					should not duplicate any personal profiles, descriptions, emails, and links without permission directly from the party.
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='24px' component='div' fontFamily='Gosha Sans' fontWeight='bold' color='#333333' sx={{ marginBottom: '28px', marginTop: '22px' }}>
					Discriminatory Behavior or Hate Speech
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					You should treat everyone with respect in every interaction. You should not treat others differently because of their race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation,
					sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, disability, or serious diseases. As a part of ADPList, we expect this our members to respect everyone, regardless of what platform
					they are on.
				</Typography>

					Violence and Threats of Violence
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit
					self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online.
				</Typography>

				<Typography fontSize='24px' component='div' fontFamily='Gosha Sans' fontWeight='bold' color='#333333' sx={{ marginBottom: '28px', marginTop: '22px' }}>
					Personal Attacks
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their
					opinions, beliefs, and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted
					respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.
				</Typography>

				<Typography fontSize='24px' component='div' fontFamily='Gosha Sans' fontWeight='bold' color='#333333' sx={{ marginBottom: '28px', marginTop: '22px' }}>
					Derogatory Language
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					Hurtful or harmful language related to background, family status, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability,
					race and/or ethnicity, caste, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location, or other attributes is not acceptable.
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure
					if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.
				</Typography>

					distribution of sexualized images or text is unacceptable.

					Influencing Unacceptable Behavior
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					We will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.

					Non-tolerated behavior from any member of Kohort, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Intentional efforts to exclude people (except as part of a
					consequence of the guidelines or other official action) from Kohort activities are not acceptable and will be dealt with appropriately.
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' fontWeight='bold' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					Failure to represent Kohort as a community member by demonstrating any non-tolerated behavior such as harassment/discrimination/hurtful language on another platform that isn&apos;t
					Kohort is not acceptable and will be dealt with appropriately.
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					Reports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the people responsible for the safety of the space, event, or activity. Appropriate measures
					will be taken to address the situation.
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					Anyone being asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Violation of these guidelines can result in anyone being asked to leave an event, group session,
					or online space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event, or being banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities in perpetuity.
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='16px' component='div' color='#333333' gutterBottom>
					Kohort staff and volunteers are also held accountable and staff in violation of these guidelines may be subject to further consequences, such as disciplinary action, up to and
