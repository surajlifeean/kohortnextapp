					CONSENT, IF NEEDED, TO COLLECT STUDENT INFORMATION. School represents and warrants that School has the authority to provide consent for Kohort to collect information from students
					before allowing students under 13 to access our Service, and that School has provided appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding School’s sharing of Student Data
					with service providers such as Kohort. We recommend that School provide a copy of our Privacy Policy to parents and guardians.

				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='18px' component='div' gutterBottom>
					This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Indian laws, without regard to the conflict of law principles. Subject to the Dispute Resolution section

					B. Arbitration.
				</Typography>
				<Typography fontSize='18px' component='div' gutterBottom>
					READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM KOHORT. In the unlikely event that
					Kohort has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after 60 days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Kohort claims for injunctive
					or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding
					arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter Act). The arbitration will be conducted in Bengaluru, unless you and
					Kohort agree otherwise, and the language of this arbitration shall be English. The dispute shall be resolved by a sole arbitrator, appointed in accordance with the Act. Any
					arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor Kohort may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of
					enforcing the arbitration award.. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for experts and other
					witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing
					Kohort from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of Kohort’s proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’
					INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
					THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. This paragraph shall survive the
					termination of this Agreement.
